### Assignment details  
Write a program that prints a 'checkerboard' pattern to the console.  

Your program should require no input and produce console output that looks like so:  

```
* * * *
 * * * *
* * * *
 * * * *
* * * *
 * * * *
* * * *
 * * * *
```

Each star or space represents a square. On a traditional checkerboard you'll see alternating squares of red or black. In our case we will alternate stars and spaces. The goal is to repeat a process several times. This should make you think of looping.
